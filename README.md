# KINECT-V2-FACE-AND-BODY-INPUT-SYSTEM-UNITY
A SINGLE FILE TO CONTROL ALL THE GAME IN 3D ANIMATION AVATAR WITH KEY BOARD/KINECT V2 SENSOR FACE AND BODY INPUT

DONT BE SO HAPPY BECAUSE YOU STILL NEED A FOLDER CONTAINING .DLL FILES BY MICROSOFT FREELY PROVIDED BUT SEEMS TO BE WORKING ONLY WITH UNITY PAID VERSIONS BUT I HAVE CRACKED IT AND YOU JUST HAVE TO COPY AND PASTE THE FILES IN PLUGIN FOLDER OF PROJECT AS SIMPLE AS I SAID.

IF ANY ONE WANTS THAT FOLDER SIMPLY ASK IT IN ISSUE AND GIVE EMIAL AND HAVE THE DRIVE LINK.

OK
